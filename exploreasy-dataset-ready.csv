Visitors can touch and feel. The park is free for everyone, it was a nice place to chill and relax. I''m sure kids like to be here especially for those who likes dinosaurs and curious with a lot of things - Wow, this is the place for you to find a decent, affordable, entertaining, near city center, all in one for the family. In here your kids can learn many things: art, tech, outer space, engineering, etc. They can also play in these places. The parents can enjoy foods in lots of food stalls here. - September 2022 => admission price is 20,000 for adults and 12,000 for children.   This is a nice place to play and learn with a low price, If you come on weekdays you will often meet groups of elementary school or kindergarten children. There are many interactive and educative games, but they look very dull and need more maintenance, some of the games are damaged and not operating. Children can play indoor and outdoor, there are also cafetaria on the ground floor. - I''ve gone to this place when it was Iedul Fitri holiday. My family had a quality time there. Taman Pintar was the best place I''ve ever visited. My kids also had the best impression and experience there, they were very happy when they visited this place. There,we could play,learn and explore anything. Taman Pintar was completed by Science and high technology. The place was so nice,exciting and wonderful. Thus, I reccommend you to visit this place..the Ticket price was very cheap. This place near to Malioboro, just takes 15 minutes walk..It was so fun guys..üòçüòçüòç - Good educational place for students range from child to teens. There are tons of fun to learn if the experimental device are available,, but unfortunately during this pandemic era, there a lot devices are prohibited or broken."
The Palace of Yogyakarta,-7.8052845,110.3642031,"Jl. Rotowijayan Blok No. 1, Panembahan, Kecamatan Kraton, Kota Yogyakarta, Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta, Indonesia",4.6,"Amazing palace.

I visited the palace in Feb 2020, and I still remember it until today.

It is an ideal place to know Javanese culture, enjoy the traditional dance and gamelan.

In addition, a visitor can know the brave Sultan‚Äôs contribution in 1825-1830, and also can learn the importance role Yogyakarta played in struggling for the independence of Indonesia.

The entrance fee is just nominal, only 10k.

Everywhere is worth seeing, everyone behaves with courtesy.

Thanks Sultan‚Äôs family for providing us visitor such a good opportunity to have a good time in this palace in Yogyakarta.üòäüôè - I guess this place is one of the top want-to-visit sites in your list in Yogyakarta. Little bit too wide to look around thoroughly but you can feel quietness and coolness inside.

It''s almost like an open-air park. I don''t know whether it''s really worth visiting for all, but only if you have a bit or more of curiosity on Indonesian culture, maybe it''s worth spending some time on it and tick the list.

Some places are not allowed to even enter, but it seems okay to enter into because it is just open. As a result, a staff runs to me and gets very angry in Indonesian language. You''d better show a warning sign in English!

If you want to take some photos, it costs you Rp. 1000.

There is an official guide you can hire for free, but mine was non-English speaker. If an English-speaking guide, my experience was more exciting? - The palace seems to be grouped into two paid sections. Both cost 15 K to enter. The first includes the royal carriages and an inside area with some artefacts. This is located opposite the parade ground. Going to the second palace, it includes more of the outside areas which will entertain some people. It''s all oddly cool on the second location outside - We came here on Sunday, so many people there. But we enjoyed it. Great historical place to visit, love the ambience. Recommend to bring your kids here, so they can learn the culture. - Great historical place to visit, love the ambience. Recommend to bring your kids here. It is crowded during weekends or public holiday."

This place oftenly busy with local tourists, and to go inside doesn''t cost much, but if you and your family want to try each of the attractions here, you need to spend more money here. They have many options like a trampolin, boom boom car, etc. The food options here also many but the taste quite average. - One of the best places in Jogja for hanging out at night with family and friends. The area is relatively large and has many ""glowing"" installations to please the eyes (especially children). Almost everything is good but I think the management guys should put on some lights on the monument itself at night to make it more standout and eye catching. - Nice place to hangout with family at night. There is various latern with unique color and shape, my son realy like. But some lantern has broken in view part,you need to be careful since the electricity still running

There is a food court with affordable price. It also has various menu, like fried rice, mie jawa, sosis, bakso.

You could find another facilities like bombomcar, trampolin , kid train, feeding rabbit,  sepeda gowes. You need to pay the ticket first (start from 20rb/person).

The entrance ticket to Taman Pelangi is 15rb/person in weekdays. 20rb/person in Friday-Sunday. Car ticket park 3rb, motorcycle ticket 2rb

Only a few toilet is opened and its not realy clean. Large parking area,you don''t need to worry. - Pretty cheap destination with such a large area full with varies of themes and lights.. Fun and attractive to see many lampions, to take photos and see the beautiful setting of the areas.. Recommended to visit at night at the city - This place is in the Monumen Jogja Kembali (Monjali) area. Not too far from Jogja Kota you can visit here using gojek/grab. A lot of visitor came here so you maybe queuing to take photo with the lampions. The retribution is 15.000rupiah/person."

I like it very much. The guide explanation is superb, you pay as you wish but please pay them enough. They take photos too! Knew the great spot. It''s clean and well taken care of as expected.

A must visit place in Jogja! - I''m in love with the view! Have to visit but not during a peak season because there were a lot of people during the school holidays. Everything was great, the weather, the color, just everything! You got to experience the Yogyakarta village after coming out of the place too, feels homey. - I will say this place amazing, because u can feel the historical, and you can also asks for a tour guide, they will tell you the history, why the building is like this and that and others. Pictures? Will be great if you took some when u are visiting. Helping strangers took pictures of them, they will be thankful for that, but dont force. - I came here on holiday with my husband. Tickets cost 5,000. It''s a historical relic. We are very happy to visit here. The guide is very well and friendly. He can explain the details about this place. Come love Indonesian heritage!! - Great little spot. I really enjoyed my time here. Unfortunately the main photo spot was ‚Äúclosed for covid‚Äù whatever that means üëÄ but the rest was very beautiful and interesting. The tunnel was otherworldly and amazing ü§©"

If you want to take photos in their iconic spots you have to pay it separately (from 15k to 50k) per spots, per person.

The food here is pretty good and the price is very reasonable for a place like this. It‚Äôs not marked up a lot.

Please use sunscreen or don‚Äôt forget to bring a hat because the temperature here is pretty wild and you‚Äôll get yourself sweat within minutes. - The view was surely breathtaking! MasyaAllah! I went there on weekdays at noon, so it''s not too crowded. The food was delicious and the price was average. The place was pretty spacious and clean.

The downside: there''s still some people who were smoking and many didn''t wear their masks properly. It''s not elderly friendly because of so many stairs.

Notes: the road was decent, but many steep inclination, so make sure your vehicle is in good condition. - A comfortable place to travel with family or camping with friends. Great view and awesome scenery. Cool atmosphere on the hill, enjoying the beauty of nature created by the Almighty God. Open until 9 pm, but for camping tours you can go until morning. - It was really such a good place, there are even some trip packages offered by them. The view, the ambience, the place are all good. You can clearly see the village below and the sunset was great but the way to go there is narrow as it''s on up hill, so you need to go all the way up and down like a mountain road, it''s already on the asphalt but the road is narrow fit two cars only but you have to be careful and sometimes one has to give in and makes way. Also many steep incline. - Good place to chill especially on sunset. They have a lot of outdoor seatings and also restaurant and cafe. You can ride the swing overlooking the hills for 30k or 50k (couple).

Would be better if it wasn''t too crowded."

Totally foggy cannot see the sun and all the view was blurry.
But still appreciate this place and it will be awesome when sun shines brightly for sure. - Great view of mountain and river from the top of the hills. Great place to do yoga. - The place is far away, access road to get there is very winding, it takes 45minutes from the city center, but the location is very beautiful, there is also a prayer room (mushola), place to eat, toilets and a large parking area. Ticket Price of admission to area is also very cheap - Went in Oct during dry season, no cloud but manage to see sunrise. Each photo spot requires to pay a fee, no trekking or hiking required, an easy walk from carpark. Have some drink or breakfast at the shop before leaving its quite a nice place to chill n enjoy the morning after sunrise. - Beautiful place. Each photo spot was charged Rp 3,000/ person (mandatory), it was worth it as the foundation for the cliff photo spots were supported with steel. There were PICs to help taking pictures. Entrance ticket Rp 2,500/ person and Rp 5,000/ car."

Walk and Sit among pine trees. Fresh air.
Entry ticket 5k idr. Better come in the morning, not too crowd. - I love the place. Not too far from Yogyakarta City. The atmosphere is really good. Nice place. Many people have their prewed photos and photoshoot here. Its a good place for someone who loves nature. One thing that bother me is the color of the trashcan. Its broght red and blue, its not blending with the atmosphere and is ruining the photos. - Paying to enter a pine forest... I really never expected to see something like that in my life before that... ü§î

‚Ä¢ Unexpectedly, the place is quite well organized.
‚Ä¢ The experience was fun and actually interesting.
‚Ä¢ Many instagrammable spots to take your picture.
‚Ä¢ a negative aspect, there were a lot of plastic waste everywhere in the nature, pretty standard for touristic places through Indonesia ü§Æ
‚Ä¢ the experience was fun and appreciable as the place was very quiet during PPKM. I would definitely NEVER go there in a ""normal crowded day"", the experience must be aweful."

Really strange that they also charge another ticket fee to take photos at one of the location (popular open hand).
This is a quiet and cool pine forest that you can literally explore in under 30 minutes or rest there all day (if you bring along snacks and drinks).
Certain areas are under maintenance and some places are dangerous for kids (broken steps to the treehouse).
A few shops are inside that sells food and souvenirs.
Great value for what you paid to come here.
Lots of very nice pine trees. - Nice and well maintained natural pine plantation. Very refreshing. And also an excellent place for photography. Warung is available in several spots. You can enjoy soda and their local drinks. There''s one famous ""open hand palm"" for photoshoot but you have to pay 3000 IDR. But there is also many good spots to take a photo so don''.t worry - A nice place with beautiful scenery. But the road going there need to be repaired. - A pine forest with lots of spot to take picture. Need to be noted that its higher than other spots with lots of trees so its rather cool compared to other spots and its a lot cheaper too, need to be wary for bugs though since its in a forest and if you bring kids be sure to hold them tight since there''s a lack of fence around - This is a pine plantation on a hill in Terong, Dlingo District, Bantul Regency, Yogyakarta Special Region with amazing arts installations and a beautiful night view down to the light festival from Yogyakarta City and around. There are food shops offering various dishes. Clean toilets and musholla (moslem prayer place). Inexpensive admission. Spacious parking lot."

Mlati, Kabupaten Sleman, Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta 55284, Indonesia",4.2,"Personally for 60k price this place was okay u can stroll everything inside with so much fun but then the main star of this place which the iconic bianglala, unfortunately it is my first time and they gave me not the best experience, ima be honest i got a little bit upset cuz we can only ride it once and i got the one with scratchy glass (the guard opened it randomly so it‚Äôs all against my will) technically i can‚Äôt see the beautiful view from above the sky. Other than that everything was pretty well average, nice experience not the best one but not the worst too - To be honest, this park was okay for IDR 60K you could ride all the attractions in the park though some were closed! If all the attractions were open, I would have given better rating! I recommend the waterpark, sepeda mabur, and the ferriswheel (note: better came to this park at the afternoon) - They have a new spot for selfies with Korean theme.
You can also borrow Hanbook for only 20K!!
They also sell some Korean Food - The place isn''t located in the main road, but still easily to reach. Parking lot is spacious.
To get inside you shall but ticket first which is varies in price depend on the privilege you''ll get inside. The cheapest one is only entrance ticket for IDR 10K and the expensive one is for IDR 65K, you''ll get to experiencing all the facilities  including swimming pool. You can find few food vendor inside, so no need fo worry if you''re hungry.
Its not too crowded when I visit, more like empty, with some rides are not operating. The place is actually good, but it''s dirty and not manage well, which make it looks rusty and abandoned, in case of some rides.
The only place where it''s crowded on my time of visit is the swimming pool, with its some big slides.
Over all, maybe if they maintenance the place better, it''ll looks well. - For you who dislike crowded amusement park, this place is recommended. It''s new and clean enough, although it has limited kind of rides. The entrance ticket is 15.000, exclude all-in tickets 70.000 for adults and 50.000 for kids under 120cm. I only pay the entrance ticket since I didn''t want to ride all. I paid the selected rides, each ranges from 10-15.000."

Near Tugu Station not far, the street very clean and not far from Alun alun jogja and other place like Museum Benteng Vredeburg, Titik 0 KM. If you come Saturday night very crowded than weekdays. - Visiting this spot on my last night in Jogja. As always, it was really crowded here. A must-visit place for people who likes to romanticise Jogja. You can sit on one of the benches, processing the vibes of Malioboro, and overthinking about your life decision amidst the people who don''t really notice your presence since they''re busy minding their own business (especially if they''re tourists). - Very popular tourist shopping street with wide extended walkways flanking the vehicular road. Crowded both during the day and at night. The traffic is only one way towards the south, so heading north would take much longer time with detour and heavy jam. Long wait for hired car too, best to travel by foot or trishaw. - The heart of Yogyakarta city, so crowded at the weekend or public holiday. So much better since the government did many renovation, they provide separately building for parking motorcycles. So much better and comfort to walking around, only need to ensure and keep clean. Maybe the government can doing the same thing to the street after across railway until ""Tugu Jogja"" monument. Along this street you can saw many art worked, buy any clothes, or buy some traditional food. - its been a long time since i traveled here and not much change but i saw improvements such as the place is much bigger for pedestrian and more organized.

If you are confused how to pose in a studio of this museum, you may see a photo pasted in every studio giving the pose suggestion. Your ability to creatively pose for photos is challenged here.

However, the space between studios is too close. It makes difficulty in taking pictures when the studio across yours is being occupied.

Enjoy D''Walik. Enjoy Yogyakarta! - We like this place. So creative. They put stuff upside down and we can take picture as many as we can. But don‚Äôt come during school holiday or weekend, you‚Äôll be wasting time waiting for other people taking pics, and you would feel awkward when people waiting for you and watching you. - An interesting place for photo shooting!

There are various types of places inside for taking pictures like the rope bridge, flying fox, golf spot.... The staffs are helpful and provides you the safety gear and helps freely.
We actually lost our car keys there and every staff helped us in finding that!
Its a personal best choice at Yogyakarta üëåüèª - The spot isn''t large, but the view is amazing. We visited this place passing a dam called Waduk Sermo, climbing up a hill with very steep and narrow road. After quite long climb...we reached the top and as I had expected (I saw the pics on Google) we saw a beautiful dam surrounded by green carpet all over the hill. - Love the place though the area is not big and it is far from anywhere. It is actually a lookout with a view to Waduk Sermo and its surrounding.
The scenery is a good and the air is fresh.
There are three ''main'' photo spots, you need to pay for each spot or have a ''package'' for all three spots - the photo spot fee is per person. The photographer can help to take photos by using their DSLR with price per picture that you want (e.g. can take 10 photos but only take 2-3 photos). You pay only the photos that you want and the pictures will be copied to your handphone by cable data. The photo spot and the DSLR''s photo fee are ''cheap'' for a tourist area. - The views are beautiful, especially during morning sun. Big and tall trees around. A view of a reservoir might be the best part. Many spots for photoshoots. Either free or paid and taken by a photographer.

But to get here is a struggle itself. The road is too steep and narrow. No clear sign that direct you to the place. Be careful because side by side is deep cliffs. The trip itself is also an amazing journey.

Parking lot is also a problem during peak season. Not really enough to accommodate visitors because it is too narrow. - Nice Place Good View... in this pandemic situation this place running the health protokol. Before entering the entry gate, all visitors must wash their hand and wear mask all the time...
Not too many visitors during the pandemic...

The entry fee are :
Rp. 10.000,- for domestic tourist
Rp. 20.000,- for foreign tourist

Something to take note of, the place consists of several small stalls and the good place to take pictures is at the side, so you can see to the bottom. We''re quite lucky to get a side place. Without waiting for too long. But the side place might not be very good to chill, since a lot of other people are waiting.

The location is quite far, and it might be quite difficult to find a way back to the city. We suggest going there with your own vehicle

As for the food I think it''s not very good, but people come here for the view, not the food. It does over a wide variety of food and snacks - This was the view from one of the cafe thereüåÉ Nice weather will give you mesmerizing twilight, and starry citylights‚ú® So really consider the weather, because it couldnt be enjoyable in the rain season.
This local tourist spot, not offering any english speaker or tourism help so far. Prices are in tourist prices. For foreigner, I recommend you to go with locals, and be humble because the services also ""locally"" standard. - Bukit Bintang is very comfortable for relaxing, relaxing the mind, the delicious food menu, the waiters are also very friendly - Great view. Thats it.
Food taste is mediocre, parking space for car is limited, no road lamp make going there at night really challenging. Is it worth it? For the view, maybe. But a lot more attraction in Jogja better than just seeing Jogja at night, in my opinion :D

If local government give more attention to detail AND safety facility, I will change the review to 5. - Good view, nice food, please ask price before order"

Don''t forget to see your kids whenever they stand alongside the river. - Nice small place . Just much suitable for people in same area . Not Recommended for visitors from others cities or foreigners because I think there is nothing especial - Nice place for family time, free entrance, easy access from downtown... inspiring tourism concept. - Me and my friend were more accurately lost but like finding treasure haha.

Best time to visit is early in the morning when no one‚Äôs here yet. You could enjoy at your best. My advice for you is just be mindful of your shoes. Choose ones with the non-slippery shoes/sandals. - Worth to visit if you wish to have tracking but limited time.
The track is fine for newbies since the paths are clear and the track is well built. The view on top is so beautiful, I can see the scenery of the South at 360¬∞.
On the down track, I found the cocoa tree as the plantain.
For the registration ticket, we need to pay 5k or 7k (forgot the exact price). - Thanks God for giving the experience to hike gunung Api Purba with my brother and my pet ''zavier'' ,
we started to hike after praying fajr through mist and darkness, and reached the top at half and hour  of our journey, while waiting for sunrise we take some photo moments and cooking our breakfast, and the rest is just... may Allah always blessing our journeys experience with faith and obedience. - The mountain is so beautiful, we can hike for about 2 km, and on the top we can see beautiful view like sunset/sunrise - Friendly for toddler who have been into adventure before.

But, over all, Prambanan is recommended place if you love heritage spot. - It was not too crowded when I went there because it was not a national holiday but just another weekend, great to take pictures because u will have the background view like colonial-era-building. - nice place to spend your holiday at yogya, it has a lot of destination. i don''t know is there any food/drink, but it''s allowed for ojek online to drop passengers. maybe some day I''ll try to travel there by trans jogja/teman bus - It''s the one of the famous landmark in Yogya.

Best time visit morning before 10am, where you can witness a ray of illumination light shines into the cave before noon. - Very beautiful cave. The operator only start the exploration 1 time a day, at 9.30am - It‚Äôs privately owned, but very well organised, and I can see that the team has safety at priority too, and equipments r good. So well worth the price for this! Very interesting and unique cave. Was able to capture the splattering sunlight. - I have mixed feelings about this tourist attraction. On the one hand, it''s well maintained and the guides are friendly and experienced. I felt really safe in their hands. on the other hand the experience was really underwhelming- it was awesome when they lowered us down into the cave (so exciting!), then we had to wait 30 minutes for them to lower everyone (boring). Then only the trek into the cave could begin. The trek in was about 15 minutes. The ""heaven''s light"" experience was cool but it wears off after 10 minutes of intense photo taking. We wanted to leave but were told we had to stay in the cave for another 45 minutes because ""that''s how long the tour lasts"" (boring!). Then when we got out, it took another 45 minutes to hoist everyone back out the cave (so so boring). In conclusion, I felt like the drive and the waiting time made up 90% of this entire experience. It should have been better organized to allow batches of people in and out of the cave, instead of doing every step as a big giant group. - First of all, its not a recreation for family with kids (5 y.o below)
(in my opinion)
You will go to a vertical cave, around 1 km diameter and 60 meter below.
Provider do it very well and safe.
Check my photos for details safety equipment.

The studio for documentaries was under maintenance when I went there.
You could find an outdoor playground in front of the museum and it is very clean. Too bad the basins were mostly broken.
I enjoyed my visit. I would love to visit other forts and museums around Jogja next time I visit. - One of the best maintained historical building or fortress.

Big parking space just before the fortress makes us easy to park our car and direcly walk to the entrance.

Tickets is really cheap.

We followed the guidelines and enjoyed ourselves, we managed to go up at the fortress watch tower and make a half way around the compound.

1,5 hours later we finished our trip and take some exciting pictures. - This place gives you very high value to what you will get in here. In here, you will learn actual fort building directly. There are also lots of diorama presenting Indonesia''s era during freedom fighting to the Dutch and Japanese aggressors. Overall, it was trully an interesting experience here, not to mention the entrance fee was very cheap, we only pally 11 k rupiah (1 adult + 4 children), can you believe it! - Museum that was a Fort built by Yogyakarta King as requested by Netherland Governor.
Inside the museum we can see the timeline history during the declaration of Indonesia Independence.
Good history site that is displayed wonderfully.
Recommended to learn our own history.
And for foreigner to know Indonesia‚Äôs history as well. - A well kept gem from the Dutch colonial era in the heart of Yogyakarta. The museum tried their best to present the city''s history through dioramas. Wished that more historical items could be displayed."

Arrival was warmly welcomed and we were ushered to various industrial centers in the village.

The thing to note is probably the parking lot. Because it is in the village in the middle of a residential area, there is no more empty space for parking. So the bus must be placed some distance away. Luckily we were escorted to the parking lot using a rabbit track or odong-odonh - Only Kamwis Rejowinangun has 5 clusters and all are still active.

Overall, it was a good experience and a great way to pass the time. - A beautiful place with amazing river view, you could go rafting and flying fox here. There are some tent over if you want to see the river in close view. The water is shallow so you could go play with water. The food price is really cheap everything is below 20k, even the tea is nice. Not really recommending bakso though, the mendoan is really nice though if you eat it while its hot.

The ticket price, for Jakartans like me it''s ok to charge IDR 89k for this kind of Fun Park but for the locals (jogjakarta residents) i think it''s a bit to expensive - Our first time here, even though our family had been living for 14 years in Yogyakarta . The ticket includes all games in the park, although some games need a separated ticket. Kids can play in many games, but adults are limited. I enjoy the bumper car with my child, and we try this game more than twice. We queue every time and the park is not so busy, because other visitors are watching live performances.
There are many toilets, mushola and food stalls. You can''t bring food outside. The food was affordable. We needed more drinks, because it was hot, but it was ok because there were many sitting areas and shades of trees.
The ticket is 99k on the weekend. I don''t know exactly when it is a weekday - A very nice kids park where they can play many activities all already included in the entrance ticket. There is a Jurassic Park inside where you go with a old car on rail and see many kinds of alive dinosaurs. Recommended - This is the first time for my son join in the gokart.

Not my first time, but i and my fam always enjoy our time here. Today, it was like a private park for us since no one''s there except the attendants. I hope more people go here. If we did all the rides, the price is very affordable. It''s like an hour at Kidzoona. My kids love the dino ride, I like the swing, and my husband seemed to enjoy the outbound-like high rope.

There is no ticket counter, you don''t need to pay for anything except for parking fee.
There are some improvements that should be applied. The most important thing is supporting facilities, for instance, clean restrooms/toilets. Since cleanliness becomes a major issue, the administrator should provide a lot of rubbish bins. - My house is a stone throw away from this waterfall, and i consider myself lucky to be able to swim and bath everyday if i wanted to.
Yes the access is minimal, the road is slippery, and almost no infrastructre but thats what keeps it beautiful.

The entrance ticket was cheap. If you want a guide, you must book in advance. There are three small temples and one main temple. You can go inside too!

I highly recommend this temple if you don''t like touristy places.

This temple just looks like a mound of land overgrown by a very green grass, but this place is one of the best spot to watch the sunset in Jogja because this temple is on the hill.

2. Visit early to Visit the Santorini Area First (few visitors), then after finish go around the mini zoo. (There''s a canopy at the mini zoo areas, less hot in the afternoon) - Consider it as a mini zoo. They offer horse riding for kids. But it''s too crowded during weekend/holidays.

The Zoo were clean and well kept, they really stepped up their game basically, after many reviews saying otherwise. Map & directions were also easy to read. Decent size of a Zoo too, nothing so huge that would take forever to cover, hated that on other Zoos.

The variety of animals are good as well, wished they had Giraffes though, would be perfect total package üëåüèª

Other big plus would have to be the shuttle rides, they were clean, and we truly appreciate the acrylic partitions in between the seats, you know these days. Schedule of pickups are very frequent, so we could ride and enjoy the whole Zoo grounds over and over.

Restaurants and restrooms are also readily avaliable although the foods are rather expensive. - The one and only real zoo in yogyakarta, it is an old zoo, but with a lot of renovation recently, they get rid of the ""old and dirty"" images that have been the image of this place for years. They have wide variety of animals, from small animals inside a terrarium, to big mammals. The area have a lot of trees to shade you from the sun when it is scorching hot, since most of the area is outdoor.

No queue at all for ticketing, just buy then enter, 2 persons got 1 physical ticket, glad my friend gave it to me as souvenir ü•∫

They also have interesting souvenir shop at the exit, too bad they didn''t put the price tag, I was interested to buy some souvenir for myself ü•≤

I love being able to visit this place. - The complex was built in 1755‚Äì1756 (AJ 1682) for Hamengkubuwono I, the first Sultan of Yogyakarta. It was one of the monarch''s first acts after the signing of the Treaty of Giyanti, which recognized the creation of the Sultanate of Yogyakarta under the Dutch East India Company.[1] A banyan forest, protected from flooding by its location between two rivers, was chosen as the site for the palace.
On 20 June 1812, Stamford Raffles led a 1,200-strong British force to attack the walled royal city of Yogyakarta. Although they outnumbered the British, the Javanese were unprepared for the attack. Yogyakarta fell in one day, and the palace was sacked and burned. A total of ¬£15,000 in gold, jewels and currency (currently valued at ¬£500,000) was looted. It was the first attack on a Javanese court, and the sultanate was subjugated to colonial authority. Most of the current palace was built by Sultan Hamengkubuwono VIII (who reigned from 1921 to 1939), and was rebuilt after earthquakes in 1876 and 2006. - amazing - Love this place, so many history

Taman Tino Sidin,-7.7995223,110.3449974,"Jl. Tino Sidin No.297, Kdipiro, Ngestiharjo, Kec.

Not only you can learn and see Bapak Tino Sidin''s paintings and drawing, but also you can try to draw using his steps. The ticket is affordable, Rp 10.000,- for adult and Rp 5.000,- for kids. - A homage mini museum for local artist, so it might not really suitable for foreigners, though if you want to learn drawing in a day, you can try to visit.

Located in a narrow and busy street, the place will be hard to miss from the road since it has a big statue of the artist at the side road.
It is the artist''s private home with some parts are converted into museum to commemorate his works.
Tino Sidin is a local artist well-know in the late 80''s to early 90''s for appearing in the national television channel. His program was a simple drawing show for kids but super popular, kids sent their drawing from all over the country in wish for being showed during the last minutes of the show. He would teach kids to draw easily with step by step instructions and gave positive feedback throughout the show. For him, all drawing is good, none is so-so let alone bad.

When you enter the front side of the house/museum, you will be met with the in house museum educator that will welcome you. Then you can write on the guest book and pay the ticket. If you are students, the price will be different. By the time I visited, regular ticket is 10k and student''s is 5k.

You can venture around the museum but be careful since it is still part of someone''s house (the late artist youngest daughter lives in the house).
The second floor contains more artworks and if you''re lucky, you can see the museum''s students'' artworks as well. FYI, they open drawing classes for kids.

At the end of the tour, the educator will let you sit on a mat and play a documentary about the artist. Then, you can learn to draw Tino Sidin style from the only remaining episode of the show (since made before the digital era, other episodes are ruined by mold and or missing from inventory T.T )

Tips:
Though it is a small museum, people come from all over Indonesia especially those who grew up during the artist''s TV program. So come early to avoid crowd since the place is small and will be packed just by coming in a group of 10.
No parking area is provided. If you go by motorbikes, you can park in front of the front door but usually the house owner parks her car there.
If you go by car, you can only park on the street side (a very busy one).
The artist''s artworks are mostly prohibited from documentation along with the only remaining episode. So, please respect the rules. - So nostalgic. The place is actually Pak Tino''s house. The guide was his daughter when we went. She was fantastic. Tickets were 10k for adults and 5k for children. At the end of the visit, we learnt how to draw by watching Pak Tino''s show from when I was a kid. I LOVED IT!
Not many yogyakartans know the place tho. Why the heck nottttt? - A special & meaningful place. P Tino Sidin is an unsung hero that has contributed greatly to build foundation of Indonesia‚Äôs artistic development - Nice place to make your children love drawing"

It''s not huge, so it shouldn''t take long to go through, but I was confused where I could and couldn''t go in the outdoor area.

Items displayed in this museum are properties owned by Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX and some photograph of life story since Dutch colonization, Japanese colonization, old order (orde lama), and new order (orde baru).

I suggest to choose bundle 35K if you want to experience the trem ride, if not, just choose 2 tickets of ainun and antique only, cause another 2 is for trem and coupon discount to purchase drink. - Worth to try if you wanna visit this place in the future.

The first one is about 30 minutes hike. The last one is one hour away from the first hut I guess. Like many places in Yogya, the way out or go down is a lot easier or less steep. Use it instead. You won''t break any rules. It''s just further from the ticket gate, no one knows it prior hiking. so people tend to use the steep track . We informed by drinking sellers up there. - Hike for 1 hour and you get to see amazing nature! It was worth it! - Great place"

This is the place to buy various traditional Kaliurang snacks - jadah, tahu tempe bacem, grubi, ampyang - and to eat Rabbit satay.

Sometimes monkeys will play around at the parking area. But not today. - A nice place to spend time among some monkeys around, and enjoy the food from the local stalls, with a gentle breeze caressing our faces üêµ - Great Cold place with Tasty foods around..
Monkeys are everywhere.. snacks for monkeys available at stores around.. - Pleasant little waterfall and nice cool jungle.  Infrastructure could use some attention. Monkeys are tame enough to get a good look, but not so tame that they''ll put their hand in your pocket and rob you.
Well worth the local price of 7rb rupiah, but foreign price (over 20x more!!) feels like a cruel joke. Definitely not worth paying 152rb. - I hope that the playground and picnic area is more than that."
Indrayanti Beach,-8.1506589,110.6126311,"Indrayanti Beach, Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia",4.5,"Beautiful, clean and thick white sand and quite far from the breaking waves, thus quite safe for children - The beach with beautiful coastal views, we can enjoy the waves and white sands from the south coast.

There''s a huge rock on the both left and right side that you can climb to see the vast blue sea. The entry tariff is cheap, only 10k rupiahs per person, and to climb the rock is 3k rupiahs

Just be careful, though. The road that heading to this beach is having so much blind spot. Drive/ride carefully, and you''ll get there. - We can get beautiful views from this beach.

You can take a 800 m - 1 km walk from the parking area to the beach, or you can ride your motorbike / take ojek motor (Rp 5000 per person). There''s a snorkeling shop facility so you can rent snorkeling equipment there. - I visited Nglambor Beach 5 year ago lol but i will give a review when i visited that day, Nglambor Beach is one of beautiful beach in Gunung Kidul area, there''s a lot of spot that u can used for take a pic ahaha also in Nglambor Beach u can snorkling, for snorkling u can rent the equipment there plus the documentation used gopro. - beatifull scenery,amazing.a bit far from entrance.

far if you go by walking to the beach.beach is hidden,need go down by walking.
you can snorkle here,and cheap for snorkling.
if you want to snorkling,please come in the morning because after 11.00am the wave become big and bigger. - The place was cool! It has many activities to offer, even for a snorkeling. You better coordinate with the admin when is the best time to snorkeling. Fee for activities also wasnt very expensive. The beach itself is still clean. Oh, use ojeg to go inside the beach. Its quite a walk to go there."

Visitors can go down into the cave behind the waterfall (but it''s not free), either through a ladder or by rappelling/abseiling through the waterfall. There are food shops and clean toilets. The path from the main road to the site still needs to be improved. - Its a beautiful and clean beach, the authorities really take care this beach, you can also see a cave, and waterfall right on it. The range of price is around 15.000 - 35.000. I have a nice time right there. They have a nice guide and will offer to help taking your picture, they won''t charge you, but don''t forget to always pay the entry to every spot you want to go. Have fun~~ p.s: the road is a bit rough, but it''s okay for bike and car to go through. - The place is small but the view is amazing! The water was crystal clear with smell of sea water.

On normal days you can see a waterfall falling down to the sea. But since there was a big wave hit the rock the other day, the waterfall was closed.

The sad thing is, there are still trashes here and there. üôÑ

The road we take, took around 1-2 hours with car from city. - Very scenic spot; great for sunset pix but not for swimming because it is too rocky and narrow for any water activity.
Jogan though offers a cave exploration tour and a small waterfall (small creek that empties into the sea). - This beach become special cos there is waterfall will flow to the sea.but so sad when i came to this beach is dry season. The waterfall is so small. Many villagers use the river for the padi field. There is cave in this beach too. U can go inside and got another view of this beach."

The sand is white, the wave is big, and the view is just great. Out of all south Java beach on Yogyakarta, this is my favorite to healing.

The access to this beach is not so easy so not many people would come, and big vehicles like buses can''t access it.
Also, there is no signal for the mobile phone, so when you come to this beach, for sure, you won''t be able to live streaming on Instagram. - I have stayed here one night with my family in May 2017 ... there is a small room on mountain just near this beach.... I took road trip from Jakarta and explored many good places in this region like Goa Pindul, Borobudur, so many places..... I love this place. - A beautiful beach with  a very beautiful scenery. There''s a lot of big coral here and the background either from bottom or from up is very good to see. A nice place to takes a pre-wedding‚Äã photo shoot here. The wave is big and good enough to see and to refresh your mind. Just sitting at the big coral near the beach and just staring at the waves makes your mind get refreshed. - This beach is freaking beautiful. But local treat it wrong, so much trash around the sands, and they sometimes asking more for the fee (illegal).

You not only could enjoying the beach but also can do a little 30 minutes hike to Bukit Pengilon and see a little waterfall called Banyu Tibo, the view is so breathtaking.

you only have to pay for retribution and parking. it costs under 15k for a person if you ride your own motorcycle. very cheap holiday option!!

Go on weekdays if you want to find some quietness! - Access to this beach is hard, not possible for bus/trucks. Therefore, this beach is still not to crowded. And still consider as hidden gem. Sands are white but not too clean. - It was a challenge to get in this place, quite remote spot and you''ll lose signal automatically. But totally worth it, beautiful scenery and white sands. Just be careful with the waves, kinda wild. It really looks like Melasti beach in Bali. - The beach is somewhat quiet, not crowded. Beautiful beach and cliffs, a lot of ponds when the tide is low.

Beware of jellyfishes, urchins, and dangerous rolling waves.

Stay safe and stay healthy. - Bit speechless about this place, because this beach have awesome landscape view. I came at 5am and still dark.. Hoping I can shoot best light in the morning.. üòÅ, but nature has different way hahaha so cloudy there.

I came to one of traditional coffee shop, after order I saw a man directly approach to our coffee shop from the beach bring an octopus and some fish.

The owner of coffee shop says.. Hai.. What would you like to order from those fresh fish..

Hahaha to early for me for heavy breakfast ..

I asking her there is other sight from the beach? She said : you have to move up to that hill..

What we don''t like: black colored sand, big waves (definitely cannot swim in it). Totally recommended place - ‚ÄúPANTAI BIRU‚Äù is the newest Hidden Gems in Jogja!  ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©

A new nature tourism for the ocean category has been found, by carrying out the family outdoor concept, Pantai Biru offers a dish of beach sand that is clean of garbage, several beachfront seafood places to eat, display of fishing boats on the beach, and interestingly, an ATV route is provided that is ready to be driven.  along with ATV rental makes this place one of the interesting tourist destinations on weekends or when the holidays arrive.

Overall the seafood dish is interesting, delicious, and cheap.  üòäüëå

""New Beach"") is a clean beach for family recreation and also offers educational ecotourism with the installation of alternative energy conversion devices (windmills and solar cell panels). With its rather high beach slope and big rolling waves, it''s not so safe spot to play water, so be careful. The inner area is green and cool with pine trees, playgrounds, outbound spots, and food shops. Many toilets available for little money.  Vast parking for motorbikes, cars and buses. Lodging is not available in the area or nearby. Local sea fishermen are active here with their motor boats. - Very nice view, ambience. Black sand, the wave is bit high so not recomend to swim. In there you can rent atv start from 30k. I think this better than kuwaru. You can also eat seafood here. But honestly the kitchen not too clean. So im not eating here, maybe later if i found more clean place/resto - The beach is so typical in that region with black and smooth sand.. however we can sit down under some pine trees to avoid the hot sunlight. Make sure you bring your own mat. I went there with my big family before 8 am so we only paid for parking.. There are ATV if we want to ride along side beach"

You can just enjoy the view or do some water sports like surfing and snorkels. If you''re a beginner, there will be local guides that will teach and accompany you. - I really recommend this place.
Such a beautiful beach with clear water.
It''s possible to do Snorkeling and Surfing since there''s some service to so that kind of stuf.
Be really careful about some rocks, it''s slippery. - Pantai wediombo is heaven on earth. Coming here would refresh your heart and your soul from this harsh world. To enter wediombo you just need IDR5K and IDR10L for car park but it maybe differ if you are not asians hahaha.

There are many choices of beach here. I visited Wediombo lagoons. Here you can swim in the ocean with low waves and you also can see crabs and fish. After swimming i enjoy Indomie and egg with my loved ones. The greatest feeling ever.

Unfortunately there isnt many things to do here aside from swimmimg, eating, and taking picture. Hopefully local governments could add many more features in this beach."

Can''t even swim there and man there''s trash everywhere.. the facility was good tho the parking fee was 10k  :/ - Nice beach though you have to pay rp 10.000 to cross small river to reach the beach - Actually this place is a fisherman''s village. It has a lighthouse at the top of the hill & fish market as well. - The beach is surrounded by mountains and greenery, but the beach it self is narrow and sometime strong waves.
Parking lot is quite spacy. We need to pay for the parking fee per vehicle. - A good place for seeing at how the fisherman get and sell their catching. There''s also some stalls nearby the coast if you need some food or beverage.

The only downside is that there is a prayer room/musholla but no dedicated space to perform wudhu. Thus we have to pay to use the bathroom only to do wudhu. The bathrooms are clean though. - Clean beach, not too crowded, big waves, best to catch sunset (if you lucky) üòä

Follow me on ig: indarwati22 for more travel inspiration - Beautiful beach, beautiful sunset and a

Foods and drinks are in reasonable price.
Comfortable parking lot but sometimes muddy.
The road is too narrow (only fit for 1 car).
Beautiful and the reef is not sharp which mean good for swimming but be careful of the big wave. - Beautiful, hidden beach located on the east side of Indrayanti beach.

This beach is very beautiful, clean and well maintained. The beach also offers snorkeling and canoeing equipment rentals. Don''t forget to climb the hill to see the stunning expanse of the South Java sea. - Mild sea waves, white sands and corals, crystal clear water, easy access.

It is located in Gunung Kidul, roughly 2 hour-drive from Yogyakarta. Snorkeling gear rental with instructor is available. Extra fee for underwater photos and videos.  Kayaking can also be another activity that you can do. Photographers are everywhere to help you taking beautiful family photos with affordable fee. The foods are also delicious on a standard price. Everything is affordable. Come and visit, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. - Around 2017 when I was in 9th grade, I visited this beach during the school tour. The road to the beach is uphill and winding because it is located in the highland. The beach is far from the main street so if you want to visit this beach, you should go using your vehicle like a car or motorbike, or you can ride the local transportation called ojek (motorcycle taxi).

This beach is not as famous as Parangtritis but the view is much better than Parangtritis beach, in my opinion. The beach is surrounded by hills because it is located in the highland, the sand is still white, and the water is still as clear as a crystal. You can also rent snorkeling equipment if you want to see the underwater creatures. There are a lot of small shops and restaurants here if you want to avoid the sunny and hot weather, and most of the shops and restaurants have rest room and praying room for the visitors. Although the scenery is beautiful, there were not much visitors at this beach, so it is the best place for you if you want to relieve the stress by seeing such a beautiful view.

Overall, this beach is a perfect destination for holiday. Even though it is far from the center of Yogyakarta, it worth the wait. The scenery is amazing, the price for foods and drinks is normal, and the local guides are really nice and helpful."

Plenty beach umbrellas but for a fee for those sensitive to sunlight. Food can be slightly expensive though. Beach is free entrance and pay for your parked vehicle. - One of many popular beach located in gunungkidul area. The beach have white sands, and very suitable for playing in the water. There isn''t much reef in the area so it is very possible to play canoe, or play in the sands. Downside of this place is the parking area have limited capacity. Cleanliness must be improved to increase the visitor''s comfort. - It''s a two-hour drive from Yogyakarta through some mountain and jungle road and some villages.

The beach was very clean. What''s unique about this beach is that there is a small coral island in the middle of the sea, accessible by bridge. You have to pay 5k IDR to pass the bridge. From that island you can have a nice and beautiful view to the layer of mountains surrounding the beach. - It is worth it yo travel 2 hours from jogja to see the brown sand and green water. It was more maintained than it was in 2003, with a lot of toilets and bathrooms, food stalls/mini restos, affordable ticket (10k per person), and mini fish market like in Depok beach. Although the price is slightly higher than depok, i could find fried baby crabs that i couldn''t find in Depok.

I rent a mat (enough for 6 people) with an umbrella, just to wait for my kids to play. I paid 30k for the mat and I ordered seafood on nearby stall. They sold 50k for each crab menu and 80k for a kilo of fried/grilled fish. It''s quite affordable.

Besides all of that, you can find many local seafood snack on this beach. And you can buy fresh fish on the fish market. - Eat seafood with beach view.

Raw fishes and other sea creatures are sold in depok fish market, just buy raw fish and choose the restaurant by yourself.

The cost of cooking in the restaurant is calculated from the weight of raw fishes we brought.

The facilities on this beach are also minimal, there are no bathrooms or toilets because this beach is still quiet and beautiful.

It''s still quiet, so it''s like a private beach.
Road access can be from the ngobaran road. Different route from the Ngobaran-Ngrenehan access road. But it looks like you can''t get close to the beach to park it.
For me, from the west side of Nguyahan Beach, climb onto the rock and walk along the path. About 10-15 minutes.
Because it is still quiet, there are no infrastructure facilities such as toilets, parking, prayer rooms and food stalls. - A beach far from noise, beautiful and amazing. Really a recommendation for camping, those who have the guts can track to Nguyahan beach, go along the beach, return via the hilly route. There are stairs about 100 meters, the rest....trabas bushes üòÅüòÅüòÅ - The beach is very quiet and very nice, those who want to go there just need patience and willpower..."

But the effort is worth it; Greweng is a cozy, not-very-wide beach with a stunningly beautiful scenery. The water is clear and rocky cliffs give us shade when it''s sunny. Not much people know (and have efforts to go to) this beach, so it feels like a private beach for anyone who get here - Hidden beach, perfect for camping in here, to reach this place you must walk 30 minutes till 1 hour, but the panorama is amazing, worth it if you look for quite place, because just some people know this place and want to go here cause of the accessibility, but the road construction still on going, hope it will be done as soon as posible - It will take 30-45 minutes to walk on the easy difficult track. Kids under 3 and moms probably won''t make it because the track is unsafe for them to walk on but after finishing the long journey, you''ll see the beautiful beach surounded by two beautiful rocks which look like a dolphin and a turtle for me lol. The view is very good, quiet because there are just some people staying there (they usually have a camp there). There are also food stalls which offer cigarettes as well. Importantly, the toilets are clean and they smell at least clean. This is the beach which will make you tired before feeling pleased after seeing its beauty."

Not really good for family trip with older people. - That''s great for camping but unfortunately you can''t swim here. You need to walk for 30mins to get here.

You should cross the bridge or use the gondola to get to the rock. It has an amazing view.

Unfortunately, for you to visit, you must rent a jeep as there''s no asphalt road to the beach. - I visited Timang Beach a year ago, it was a bit windy and drizzling. Not recommended to go there while it''s drizzling or raining because it could get very slippery out there, but if you like a challenge then it''s recommended to go there and take a ride on the gondola. If you wanted to go there you have to book a small jeep in advance, the trail from near village to Timang Beach is really small thus you need to hire a jeep - Getting to this place took almost 2 hours from the city, plus a 20 minutes jeep ride. It is good for a one-time visit, nothing much to see/explore. Also, the gondola wasn‚Äôt as extreme as I thought‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs very mid actually - It‚Äôs a beautiful and instagram worthy place. We took some effort to reach there as it‚Äôs about 2 hours+ from centre of Yogyakarta and not accessible by regular cars,hence you will need to rent a jeep. Anyway the view was great and worth the trip. Plus, you can enjoy lobster meal at nearby restaurants. - This place is a paradise at yogja. Its a must visit place. What is roller coaster ride compared to a gondola ride if you have fear with heights and water. The ticket is IDR300k for the jeep which can accommodate 5 people in it to take you up to the view point and where the gondola and hanging bridge is. Once you reach there, you can choose if you want go for gondola or hanging bridge. Its a separate ticket which is IDR200k each for per person. Don''t forget put on sunscreen and bring water bottle. The guides are very friendly and will capture good photos for free. Just becarefull of your belongings and cash inside wallet when you put in into the locker before getting into the gondola because my cash got missing and there is no cctv in the locker room."

There will be information about how this temple was built.

Main features: Sanctuary type 4 facing west.
State of preservation: Only bases remain.
Description: Up to now, four buildings have been excavated6. Three of them form the ‚Äúmain compound‚Äù. The fourth structure, located some 50m away, constitutes the ‚Äúsecondary compound‚Äù.
The main compound is formed from a central temple and two secondary structures standing in a row.
The base of the main building is 4,50m square, with a projecting staircase to the west. Unfortunately, nothing remains of the temple body, except the 1m square cella pit.
The secondary structures are located to the north and south of the central temple. Only 2,40m square foundations remain. Curved stones with padma-mouldings found around the compound suggest that these secondary constructions were actually st≈´pa.
Remains of another structure are visible 4m to the south of the southern secondary building. Whether this was a temple, a st≈´pa or part of an enclosure is not known.
The secondary compound is not on a line with the main compound. It houses only one small square base. - Good views - Still natural temple - One that has beautiful, distinctive reliefs is the Gampingan Temple, a temple that was discovered by accident by a brick craftsman in Gampingan Hamlet, Piyungan, Bantul in 1995. Even though it is small in size and is no longer intact, Gampingan Temple is still rich in reliefs dazzling.

One of the beautiful reliefs that can be found in this temple is the animal relief at the foot of the temple. The animal reliefs at Gampingan are so natural that one can identify the type of animal depicted. It is quite rare for temples to have such reliefs, at least only Prambanan and Mendut Temples are known to have similar reliefs. All of these reliefs are decorated with tendrils as a background, namely padmamula (lotus root) which is believed to be the source of life.

When YogYES went around, it seemed that the dominating type of animal was a bird. There is a relief of a crow which appears to have a large beak, a sturdy body, wings spreading upwards and a fan-shaped tail. There is also a relief of a woodpecker which is described as having a crest on its head, a rather long and pointed beak and unspread wings. Apart from that, there are also roosters who have bloated chests and wings that spread downward.

The making of bird reliefs in large quantities in this temple is related to the belief of the people at that time in the transcendental power of birds. It is believed that birds are the embodiment of the gods as well as messengers from the realm of the gods or nirvana. Birds are also associated with absolute human freedom which is achieved after successfully leaving worldly life, a symbol of the human soul that is separated from its body.

Another animal relief that is also widely depicted is the frog. At that time, people believed that frogs had supernatural powers that could bring rain, so frogs were also believed to be able to increase productivity, because the rainwater that frogs brought in could increase crop yields. The frog that often emerges from the water also symbolizes the renewal of life and awakening towards a better direction.

Until now, the relief still leaves the question, whether it is a fable (animal story told to children) like in Mendut Temple or a depiction of an animal that is deliberately made to show a certain purpose. This question arose because animal descriptions such as those in Gampingan Temple were not found in books containing fables, such as the Jataka, Sukasaptati, Pancatantra and their derivative versions. - The temple site is made of white stone, all that looks intact is the foot of the temple, and several stones that cannot be stacked are placed in a corner of the garden. the temple is in the middle of rice fields. When I came here the site door was locked during the day. come early if you want to enter the temple site. happy historical tour."
Prambanan Temple,-7.7520206,110.4914674,"Jl. Raya Solo - Yogyakarta No.16, Kranggan, Bokoharjo, Kec. Prambanan, Kabupaten Sleman, Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta 55571, Indonesia",4.7,"Prambanan Temple in Indonesia is a truly breathtaking and awe-inspiring place to visit. Located in the Central Java region of the country, this ancient temple complex is a testament to the incredible skill and creativity of the Javanese people.

The temple itself is a masterpiece of architecture and design, with beautiful and ornate carvings adorning every inch of its surface. The intricate details and attention to detail are truly breathtaking, and it''s clear that a great deal of time and effort went into the construction of this temple.

In addition to the temple itself, the grounds of Prambanan are also home to a number of other smaller temples and structures, each of which is equally impressive and worth exploring. The entire complex is surrounded by lush, verdant gardens, which provide a beautiful and peaceful setting for visitors to explore and take in the sights and sounds of this historic site.

Overall, I would highly recommend a visit to Prambanan Temple to anyone traveling to Indonesia. Whether you''re interested in history, architecture, or simply want to experience the beauty and culture of this incredible country, this temple is a must-see destination. - You might not be actually interested in this Hindu temples but you''re just going to visit here because your tour package includes this site together with the Borobudur, or just because it''s one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Don''t worry. Me too.

There are black and ashy spires and tons of rubbles in the perimeter surrounded by nature. Lots of Hindu gods reliefs are etched on the stones, and some statues are enshrined in the cave. Sounds attractive?

Considering it is built in the 9th century it''s amazing. But to be honest, it''s no exciting. A lackluster type of historic site.

If I''m well-versed in its historic backgrounds and Hinduism itself, viewpoint changes? - As a foreign tourist, when you go to buy the entry tickets to these temples, be ready to get shocked. The entry ticket is exorbitantly priced, but believe me it is worth every penny you are paying.
We were literally blown away by the beauty of these magnificent temples. Words are not enough to describe it. No matter how long you see and appreciate this beauty, you can never have enough of it. You should not miss it at all when in Yogyakarta.
Watching sunset at these temples is the literally WOW..!! Check the pics.
One smart tip: Buy the combined entry ticket for Prambanan and Borobudur temples. Both are super expensive, but combined you get some discount on it. - Hugely impressive site with an incredible heritage and story. I‚Äôd come here early to avoid the heat as there‚Äôs a huge space to enjoy and walk around. Good for the family.

Heads up the main temple is currently ongoing renovating the 200+ small temples around the site and according to latest estimates could take about 200 years! There‚Äôs a bit of noise but it doesn‚Äôt derail too much from the experience and communicates the effort involved in restoring the temple to its former glory. - Fantastic temple complex with plenty to see. Really enjoyed taking my time exploring the reconstructed structures across the grounds. The architecture is beautiful. You can buy a combo ticket for Borobudur aswell. Definitely worth a visit!"

Its absolutely beautiful small temple complex. Two big structures are still standing tall, whereas other smaller ones are in ruins. But the magnificence of the temple will blow you away. A must visit site which is not very far from the Prambanan complex. - The temple is one of the crowdless one near to Prambanan. It looks similar in co struction but very less crowded.
The idols at the places are missing and renovation works are still happening. The place looks like a remain of an olden hindu temple which would have been a really big place of worship.
The entry fee is 50k for foreigners and 20k for locals.
Compared to spending more at Prambanan, i would suggest visiting this temple. - If you already been to Prambanan, you should try Candi Plaosan. It''s not very big neither small temple who has been damaged by earthquake, but still most important parts of the temple are standing. - Good value for money.  Its the only temple we''ve been to that we were allowed to enter.  There were helpful photo/tour guides who arent pushy and were very helpful. - A beautiful 9th century temple complex surrounded by serene landscape of paddy field. The place is clean and not crowded.

The best time to visit this temple are either in the morning or in the afternoon around 3pm-5pm (it closed on 5pm).
Unfortunately, now we can''t enter the 2 main temples (maybe because of the pandemic or for preservation reasons).

Don''t miss the beautiful carvings of decorative motifs, heavenly beings, and the bodhisattvas.

Travel Guides to Indonesia

We used¬†Lonely Planet`s Indonesia¬†book on our travels around Indonesia and Bali. It was great!

1) ùêíùê°ùê¢ùêØùêö ùêìùê´ùê¶ùê©ùê•ùêû :-

The Candi Shiva Mahadeva temple, dedicated to Shiva, is not only the largest of the temples of Prambanan but also the finest. The main spire is incredibly aroun 40-5 m high and its stones are beautifully carved.
The Shiva temple contains five chambers, four small chambers in every cardinal direction, and one bigger main chamber in the central part of the temple.
Its base is decorated with small lions flanked by kalpatura (trees of heaven), as well as stylized half-human and half-bird kinnara (heavenly beings). Aren`t they  ùêØùêûùê´ùê≤ ùêõùêûùêöùêÆùê≠ùê¢ùêüùêÆùê•?

2) ùêïùê¢ùê¨ùê°ùêßùêÆ ùêìùêûùê¶ùê©ùê•ùêû :-
The Candi Vishnu temple is smaller than the impressive Shiva Mahadeva temple and sits just north of it, reaching around 30-40 m in height. Of course, we had to walk the steep stairs up to the top plateau. And it was totally worth the climb as the temple is magnificent containing reliefs telling the story of Lord Krishna who is the hero of the Mahabharata story.

The most impressive part of this temple is, in my opinion, the statue of a four-armed Vishnu the Preserver in the inner chamber. It is so really big and beautifully carved.

3)ùêÅùê´ùêöùê°ùê¶ùêö ùêìùêûùê¶ùê©ùê•ùêû:-

This temple is the twin temple of Candi Vishnu, as they are exactly similar! It is situated just south of the big Candi Shiva Mahadeva temple, so the two twin temples make a nice symmetric scene.

When you enter this temple, look up and admire the spectacular ‚Äúmonster mouth‚Äù doorway, which is beautiful.

ùêéùê≠ùê°ùêûùê´ ùêèùê•ùêöùêúùêû :-

Nandi temple¬†‚Äì Contains a statue of bull Nandi belonging to Shiva, as well as¬†the statue of Chandra the god of the moon, and Surya the god of the sun. Chandra stands on his carriage pulled by 10 horses, and the statue of Surya is also standing on a carriage pulled by 7 horses.

Hamsa/ Angsa temple¬†‚Äì ¬†Contains no statue, but it probably once housed a statue of the sacred swan Hamsa for the god Brahma.

Garuda temple¬†‚Äì Neither this temple contains a statue. Probably this temple once contained the statue of kite Garuda belonging to god Vishnu. Garuda holds an important role for Indonesia, as it serves as the national symbol of Indonesia, and also as the name of the airline Garuda Indonesia.

When you enter this temple, look up and admire the spectacular ‚Äúmonster mouth‚Äù doorway, which is beautiful.

Prambanan is the biggest and most complete remains of Java`s period of Hindu culture, built in the middle of the 9th century AD, around 50 years later than Borobudur. Little is known about its early history, but it is believed that it was built by king Rakai Pikatan to mark the return of a Hindu dynasty in Java after decades of Buddhism. Prambanan was completely in ruins for years until 1937 when the reconstruction started,  and it is still far from complete.

Even though Prambanan is a big tourist sight, it was peaceful and not too crowded when we visited. We could easily walk around the complex and take in its atmosphere. Prambanan is much more relaxed than Borobodur, here we were left alone and not hunted down by Indonesian wanting to take selfies with us. - Brahma is a Hindu God as ""the Creator.""
One of the trinity of supreme divinity in Hinduism.
He is associated with creation, knowledge, and the Vedas.
Brahma is traditionally depicted with four faces and four arms.
*learning for myself - good stone formation - Comprising the remains of some 244 temples, World Heritage‚Äìlisted Prambanan is Indonesia''s largest Hindu site. The highlight is its central compound, where its eight main and eight minor temples rise up majestically like ornate 9th-century skyscrapers. Erected in the middle of the 9th century ‚Äì around 50 years later than Borobudur ‚Äì little is known about its early history. It‚Äôs thought that it was built by Rakai Pikatan to commemorate the return of a Hindu dynasty to sole power in Java."

Travel Guides to Indonesia

We used¬†Lonely Planet`s Indonesia¬†book on our travels around Indonesia and Bali. It was great!

1) ùêíùê°ùê¢ùêØùêö ùêìùê´ùê¶ùê©ùê•ùêû :-

The Candi Shiva Mahadeva temple, dedicated to Shiva, is not only the largest of the temples of Prambanan but also the finest. The main spire is incredibly aroun 40-5 m high and its stones are beautifully carved.
The Shiva temple contains five chambers, four small chambers in every cardinal direction, and one bigger main chamber in the central part of the temple.
Its base is decorated with small lions flanked by kalpatura (trees of heaven), as well as stylized half-human and half-bird kinnara (heavenly beings). Aren`t they  ùêØùêûùê´ùê≤ ùêõùêûùêöùêÆùê≠ùê¢ùêüùêÆùê•?

2) ùêïùê¢ùê¨ùê°ùêßùêÆ ùêìùêûùê¶ùê©ùê•ùêû :-
The Candi Vishnu temple is smaller than the impressive Shiva Mahadeva temple and sits just north of it, reaching around 30-40 m in height. Of course, we had to walk the steep stairs up to the top plateau. And it was totally worth the climb as the temple is magnificent containing reliefs telling the story of Lord Krishna who is the hero of the Mahabharata story.

The most impressive part of this temple is, in my opinion, the statue of a four-armed Vishnu the Preserver in the inner chamber. It is so really big and beautifully carved.

3)ùêÅùê´ùêöùê°ùê¶ùêö ùêìùêûùê¶ùê©ùê•ùêû:-

This temple is the twin temple of Candi Vishnu, as they are exactly similar! It is situated just south of the big Candi Shiva Mahadeva temple, so the two twin temples make a nice symmetric scene.

When you enter this temple, look up and admire the spectacular ‚Äúmonster mouth‚Äù doorway, which is beautiful.

ùêéùê≠ùê°ùêûùê´ ùêèùê•ùêöùêúùêû :-

Nandi temple¬†‚Äì Contains a statue of bull Nandi belonging to Shiva, as well as¬†the statue of Chandra the god of the moon, and Surya the god of the sun. Chandra stands on his carriage pulled by 10 horses, and the statue of Surya is also standing on a carriage pulled by 7 horses.

Hamsa/ Angsa temple¬†‚Äì ¬†Contains no statue, but it probably once housed a statue of the sacred swan Hamsa for the god Brahma.

Garuda temple¬†‚Äì Neither this temple contains a statue. Probably this temple once contained the statue of kite Garuda belonging to god Vishnu. Garuda holds an important role for Indonesia, as it serves as the national symbol of Indonesia, and also as the name of the airline Garuda Indonesia.

When you enter this temple, look up and admire the spectacular ‚Äúmonster mouth‚Äù doorway, which is beautiful.

Prambanan is the biggest and most complete remains of Java`s period of Hindu culture, built in the middle of the 9th century AD, around 50 years later than Borobudur. Little is known about its early history, but it is believed that it was built by king Rakai Pikatan to mark the return of a Hindu dynasty in Java after decades of Buddhism. Prambanan was completely in ruins for years until 1937 when the reconstruction started,  and it is still far from complete.

Even though Prambanan is a big tourist sight, it was peaceful and not too crowded when we visited. We could easily walk around the complex and take in its atmosphere. Prambanan is much more relaxed than Borobodur, here we were left alone and not hunted down by Indonesian wanting to take selfies with us. - Vishunu is a Hindu God as ""the Preserver.""
One of the trinity of supreme divinity in Hinduism.
In Vaishnavism, Vishnu is the supreme being who creates, protects, and transforms the universe.
Vishnu iconography shows him with dark blue, blue-gray or black colored skin, and as a well dressed jeweled man.
*learning for myself - The panels depict the life of Hindu god Krishna. Fortunately it also gives a fascinating picture of life in Java about 1200 years back.
Invaluable! - The beautiful hindhu Vishnu temple"

Religion: Unknown.
Main features: Single temple; facing west; enclosure wall.
State of preservation: The temple is now reduced to a mere mound, but a short part of its wall is still visible on the eastern side.
Description:
This temple, still visible at the beginning of the 19th century, was turned to the west (Brumund 1854:53; Verbeek 1891: 171). In 1889, it had already almost completely disappeared (Verbeek 1891: 171). In 1989, the SPSP DIY carried on a work of prospecting. It revealed that, although the remains had been badly damaged by the construction of a retaining wall to protect the road, parts of the structure were still in situ (Laporan identifikasi Tinjon 1989). Excavations allowed digging out part of the temple eastern wall144. Traces of an enclosure wall were visible 8m east from the temple base and also in the north and northeastern parts of the site. The enclosure must have measured more or less 57 x 65m (Laporan identifikasi Tinjon 1989:9).
Today, some stones of the eastern wall and of the enclosure wall are still visible, but the temple body is reduced to a pile of earth mixed with stones.
The wall was not entirely excavated, so that it is impossible to know the dimension of the sanctuary. Only the first stones of the base were visible. The moulding was not complete but seems to have been characterized by a high and plain plinth."

Near harvesting time, the rice fields will turn golden brown, even better photo opportunity. - It is 1 of 3 mountains in the Seyegan sub-district, Sleman DIY. Although not very popular, this mountain is quite often used as a camping site.

With a height of only about 400m, Ngampon is more accurately called a hill, because according to the Encyclopaedia Britannica a bulge of land on the surface of the earth can be called a mountain if its height is more than 2000ft or 610m.

Around Mount Ngampon there are 2 springs that never dry throughout the year and are used daily by residents to meet their clean water needs: Tuk Sibedug and Berduwur.

Since 2011 there has been a discourse to develop this hill into a tourist area, but due to funding constraints to build facilities for visitors this year it has not been realized.
Even so now some developments have been seen such as tree houses, small quiet ponds, and hiking trails.

The development of an area is often a dilemma, on the one hand the management of being a tourist attraction will provide economic growth, but on the other hand the preservation of nature will certainly be threatened. There have been many developments of an area into a natural tourist attraction ending with changing the naturalness of the place and because of the very low awareness of local tourists, places that were once naturally beautiful have become graveyards of plastic waste. - Unfortunately at this time the condition is less maintenance. üòë - The mountain is not very high - Looking for Duwet Fruit #anggurjowo"

The older building is particularly noteworthy for its detailed descriptions and instructions, which can make the exhibits more engaging and educational.

However, the newer building has a more modern feel to it. Unfortunately, the exhibits in this building lack detailed descriptions, which may make it less engaging for some visitors. Overall, both buildings have a lot to offer, and visitors should take the time to explore both to get the most out of their visit. - Nice museum to visit if you have some extra time in the city. The old part is a bit sad, so I‚Äôd recommend moving fast to the new building. English translations are a bit poor or provide useless information at times. Price is reasonable, 20K. - The museum is still very well maintained.  By paying a ticket for 10K, I can enjoy the entire Sonobudoyo museum in a wonderful way.  It''s a very exciting experience to be able to find out how the previous historical conditions were. there is also a mushola facility, there is also a puppet show which can be enjoyed by paying an additional 20k. - If you are looking for another place to visit in Malioboro area, this place must be on top of the list.

It costs around 5k-10k for general admission. The museum staff offered me a free guide, but i chose to walk by my self. Their collections are very complete, most of them are historical relic that found in Yogyakarta. But they have some collections from other area as well, such as East Java and Bali.

Some rooms looked well maintained and clean, but some of them looked old and dusty. But overall it''s a nice museum.

You can also take a pre-wedding photos here, i don''t know how much it costs, but i think this could be a choiceüòÅ - Sonobudoyo presents various collections of culture in Java and Bali.

The third gallery accommodates his wife and his daughter''s paintings.

Upon arrival, you will be pleasantly pleased that your ticket comes with a free drink. However do note that there is an additional fee if you plan to take pictures within the museum.

As you explore each section of the museum, you will be taken on a journey through the evolution of Afandi‚Äôs painting style, and stories behind each artwork. The way each painting exudes passion and emotion in every stroke is truly mesmerizing and will leave you in awe.

Overall, Museum Afandi is a fantastic art museum that is definitely worth a visit. The paintings are beautiful, and the museum is thoughtfully curated to provide an informative and engaging experience for visitors. - Returning after 25 years to.the Gallery..
Still in awe of his style and brushwork... a definite must visit if you come to Yogya. - Good selection of Affandi paintings. I was equally impressed by his daughter‚Äôs paintings also exhibited there."

She was very thorough in her explanation and accompanied us to the second floor. The visit was free. Thank you for giving me and the kids the information about the history of cryptology in Indonesia.
PS: the building where the museum is housed aged over 100 years old. It was the Foreign Ministry building during the 1940s era. Lots of history! - Entrance to this museum is free, and there''s even guided tour if you want extra explanation. Mostly exhibits tools and history related to cryptography, the place is located not fat from city centre (easy to access). And inside there''s air conditioner which makes visiting there comfortable. Maybe for improvement, this place would be much better if there''s more collection (for example interactive animation/ diorama).

Overall, very worth to visit - It''s a place to learn about the history of the cryptography in Indonesia with the authentic things that is still stored and kept by the currator. It''s a new experience for us because in the beginning, the system is restricted and not publically for everyone. Join the adventure and feels the happiness - This museum is underrated. It''s full of historical story. The building itself is the original witness for cryptography development in Indonesia. There are information texts in English for international visitors. Unfortunately, some information texts were covered with the collections. Entrance ticket was free, there''s parking space available. Too bad that they only have few visitors for a day.

Make sure you don''t miss any single shelf since each country has their own unique items.
Then you will go to the second floor which has more of Indonesian maritime stuffs being displayed with a little bit of foreign items, too.
After that, the museum staff will ask you to come to the ''ship'' building nearby the exhibition building. You will go to the second floor where you can enter a small bridge (the commando room). The last stop would be a small theater room below the bridge. You will watch a short movie about the history of Indonesian maritime. Don''t miss the movie since it is very good (disclosure: the movie is in Bahasa) - Great place to teach the children about the maritime of Indonesia. It''s cheap and clean. - for only IDR 2K for the admission ticket, this museum is small indeed. there is a two-story building with seemingly private collection of documents, warship and navy boat models, statues, insignias, etc. it also lacks of lighting (it was turned off even when we come visiting the room). probably the most interesting part is only the ship bridge which contains ship''s wheel, maps cabinet, electronic instruments, etc. you could take nice instagram picture here. - While named as Maritime Museum (Museum Maritime), most of this museum collection is Indonesian Navy paraphernalia. This should not surprise you if you know that the founder of this museum is an Indonesian Navy Officer.

Coming to this museum we are greeted by a naval gun turret. Behind the gun is a mock ship bridge, in fact the lay out of the whole building looks like ship if seen from afar.

As mentioned above, you would find Indonesian Navy paraphernalia such as uniform, officer sword, and rank badge/epsulette. It would be fascinating to kids who loves all thing military. Of course you could buy some stuff in this museum.

It''s true that there are no sign to catch the museum because its become one with the hospital. You can ask the security. There is an educator who can tell and take you around the museum. There are 3 rooms. First room is containing the equipments that dr. Yap and his son used to treat their patients. Second one is containing the household appliances of dr. Yap''s family. The third one is containing picture of his family and him. Also some of their collectibles. I recommend you to ask the educator to take you around the museum.

Pleasant place to walk around. It''s quite hard to navigate without a guide but that was half the fun. Not a huge amount to see and quite busy. Perhaps having a guide to tell us more of the history would have made it more interesting. - Pretty darn amazing.  I am not one to normally hire a local to give me a private tour.  Maybe I am too proud (or cheap) but I was reluctant to let some random guy off the street walk us through the water castle.

Either way we did let him stick around and tell us the history (or his version of the history). I have to say it was a great decision to walk around with him.  He had a plethora to say about each and every room and the rooms function.  If he wasn''t there I probably would have been guessing at each and every rooms intended role.  The tour went easily over an hour and we saw several rooms I would not have seen unless we were following our guide.

The craftsmanship and size of this place was impressive and I am glad we took the time to go out there.  It''s located a walking distance from the sultan''s castle and both could easily be done in the same day.  I would recommend coming out to see this. - The most historical place that has a lot of story.  There are a lot of local tour guide that you can find to guide you if you need information about the places indeed.
If you like about photography this place is very recommended to be visited because there are a lot of beautiful angles that you can capture. The admission price is cheap for local tourist is around 5k and non local tourist *if I''m not mistaken around 10k rupiah - A nice place for a short visit and walk around the adjacent community. The castle is in poor condition. The community is filled with eateries, artists, and restaurants. - Beautiful heritage site, however there is nothing much here and it was a little bit overrated.

There are outdoor and indoor area for kids to play in. My toddler loves the airplane so much and she was so happy the entire time she spent at this museum .

The collection of military air plane are considered comprehensive . Kids can play with the collection and get inside them wherever permitted.

The downside for the indoor museum that is not in air conditioned room. Yogyakarta government should commercialised this area so that it can attract more foreign tourists from all over the world. Moreover, not many locals are familiar on how to go this museum as well. The grab driver that we hired to go to museum was kinda lost and had to make a few turns to get it right.

For Friday visit, do note that there is Friday prayer for the locals . Hence try to avoid visiting between 11am-1pm as this is their break and prayer time . - It is safe to say that most people love airplanes; that is why I think this place is a cool place to visit.

This museum is located in Indonesian Air Force Complex; it contains history and retired airplanes that was previously served in the Air Force.

It is cool to take pictures with war machines that most of us can only see in movies. - The tickets are cheap. Ten thousand rupiahs for car parking. Six thousand rupiahs for each visitor. The area is spacious. There are outdoor and indoor area for kids to play in. The collection of military air vehicles are good though not updated. Kids can play with the collection and get inside them wherever permitted. Overall the museum is a nice place to spend time with kids on weekends. - Costs 10k for foreigners to get in and it''s a bit difficult to find the entrance as it''s in the middle of an airforce base. Some minor works are occuring on the main building but you get the main idea of what''s happening. There is lots of rather dry info on the airforce but lots of military equipment, both soviet and western which shows Indonesia''s history.

There''s a lot of collections, even though half of them are islam stuff, like al quran from the 17th century. The translation is not that understandable tho. - It''s a right place to visit if you want to learn a bit about the history of Java. In the beginning, we''ll watch a video about how the Java island was created.

Then, the guide will bring us to see the collection of bronze statues, puppets, ceramics, and many more.

The museum supports AR, but to access this, we need to download an app beforehand. So far, the AR only shows pictures of old buildings, animals, etc. I hope they can develop it to be more advance.

Once we have finished seeing the collections, we will be brought to watch a 3D video about dinosaurs. It has nothing to do with the Java island, but it''s quite funny. I bet your kids will like it.

The last room is diorama room. There are spots to take photos in here.

The ticket fee is 35K per person. It includes the guide as well. - Lots of knowledge regarding Yogyakarta and even Javanese culture.  They even have shop to buy things for your loved ones. - One of the best and large museums in Yogyakarta. Located on the south part of the region, It is very easy to spot the place. Just look for a tall white pyramid and you''ll see it clearly. It used to be a building used for receptions & event but turned into a private owned museum.
The parking lot is super wide with small stalls of food vendors.
Ticket price is affordable for such scale of museum with a guide part of the ticket fee, unlimited sightseeing time, short movie & a free mini studio for pictures; more about them below.
Once you enter the museum, a guide will welcome you. If you''re lucky, you''ll get the in house guide, but sometimes they only have high school student interns (those major in tourism) as the guide but with limited knowledge. They can still tell you about the exhibits, though, but won''t know information beyond the written text available.
At first, they let you sit and watch a short movie about Java''s history. Then the guide will take you to the next sections.
They have many sections related to the history of Java and the guide will explain to you  throughout the way. You are free to stop at every item & read with no limited time, unless the place is crowded, you can have simply unlimited time.
Some of the information are available for an Augmented Reality effect. You have to download the app first, it''s free. But it would be best to notify the visitors after buying ticket to download the app since inside the museum, the receptions are a bit difficult.
After that, the last section is a 3D short cinema though unrelated at all - about a baby dinosaur ventured beyond its lair. The 3D glasses are unfortunately worked poorly and couldn''t give you the 3D effect at all.
The last exhibition is actually a small photo rooms with various backgrounds (Javanese history related) with some props that you can use and wear.
The relatively new museum then handed me a simple questionnaire to fill related to my opinions on the museum. Thumbs up to their effort to keep getting better. Beyond the photo studio is an open area for extra events, so I believe they also rent that section.
It would be nice to see the museum keeps getting better.
Tips: download the app  (History of Java Museum AR) prior entering the museum.
Come early to get the whole museum for yourself.
Call them prior the visit to avoid large groups since schools and company visits are seldom occur.
Some areas prohibit you to take pictures, so be mindful. - A great museum with a fine collection of javanese culture and history. They had a big parking spot and a unique pyramid exterior, very easy to spot from the road.

The entrance ticket cost Rp 35.000 (all in including guide). When we step in, first they showed us a short movie about the history of java. The collection room divided into 3 part + 1 extra about keraton (kingdom) in Jogjakarta and Solo. You are allowed try to play the gong. After the collection room, you can take a picture with their diorama. They also provided javanese traditional clothes as a prop for free for you to wear. At the end of the tour, they give us questionnaire form. They also ask us to take a video about our testimony.

But sadly, my guide didn''t know a thing about the collection. She can''t even answer basic question about the history. This really gives this museum a bad impression for me."

Teras Malioboro 1 is very clean and the wall decor outside is really beautiful too. There are many people who take photos with the background of the wall decor. The words on the wall are very touching.

In my opinion, the things that are sold are complete too.

Thank you very much Teras Malioboro 1. I hope someday I can come here again. - It was great there..
I went early in the morning, so it''s not ready yet for all shop to open it..

But i enjoy my breakfast (follow the exit direction).. I ordered Pecel (it''s rice, vegetable and peanut sauce) and  Dawet for drink..

Hope you enjoy - one stop shopping area, location in Malioboro, close to Beringharjo market, zero km, Vredeburg Fort, there are sellers of typical Jogja souvenirs and food.  there are toilets and prayer rooms.  There is a menu price list so buyers don''t have to be afraid of being lied to - Since early February 2022, most handicraft and food stalls are moved to 2 new locations; Malioboro Teras 1&2. Outside the main facility of Teras 1 food vendors are given standardized push carts, unfortunately, they lose the previously unique identity. But, of course, with limited space the city planners have to make compromises on the size and design of the small push carts. Instead of sitting on the mats (lesehan), now tables and chairs are provided indoor as well outdoor locations. - Malioboro has reorganized the pedestrians and moved the street vendors into Teras Malioboro 1 and 1 near Beringharjo Market. Teras malioboro 1 is clean and good place to shop for a cheap price. One suggestion is I think they need to provide air conditioner in it since it,s really hot with only a fan."

So far, the best bakpia I have had in Jogja. You can tell they use high quality ingredients. The moist skin and smooth filling melt in your mouth.

Staff was friendly, from all of type of bakpia kurnia sari is the best one in my opinion. - This place sale bakpia, it''s a local snack.

Access to the location is easy but quite challenging so you need to be careful. - The spot is easy to reach, not far from Malioboro - + 30-40 minutes.

Something to take note of, the place consists of several small stalls and the good place to take pictures is at the side, so you can see to the bottom. We''re quite lucky to get a side place. Without waiting for too long. But the side place might not be very good to chill, since a lot of other people are waiting.

The location is quite far, and it might be quite difficult to find a way back to the city. We suggest going there with your own vehicle

As for the food I think it''s not very good, but people come here for the view, not the food. It does over a wide variety of food and snacks - This was the view from one of the cafe thereüåÉ Nice weather will give you mesmerizing twilight, and starry citylights‚ú® So really consider the weather, because it couldnt be enjoyable in the rain season.
This local tourist spot, not offering any english speaker or tourism help so far. Prices are in tourist prices. For foreigner, I recommend you to go with locals, and be humble because the services also ""locally"" standard. - Bukit Bintang is very comfortable for relaxing, relaxing the mind, the delicious food menu, the waiters are also very friendly - Great view. Thats it.
Food taste is mediocre, parking space for car is limited, no road lamp make going there at night really challenging. Is it worth it? For the view, maybe. But a lot more attraction in Jogja better than just seeing Jogja at night, in my opinion :D

If local government give more attention to detail AND safety facility, I will change the review to 5. - Good view, nice food, please ask price before order"

I love being able to visit this place. - The complex was built in 1755‚Äì1756 (AJ 1682) for Hamengkubuwono I, the first Sultan of Yogyakarta. It was one of the monarch''s first acts after the signing of the Treaty of Giyanti, which recognized the creation of the Sultanate of Yogyakarta under the Dutch East India Company.[1] A banyan forest, protected from flooding by its location between two rivers, was chosen as the site for the palace.
On 20 June 1812, Stamford Raffles led a 1,200-strong British force to attack the walled royal city of Yogyakarta. Although they outnumbered the British, the Javanese were unprepared for the attack. Yogyakarta fell in one day, and the palace was sacked and burned. A total of ¬£15,000 in gold, jewels and currency (currently valued at ¬£500,000) was looted. It was the first attack on a Javanese court, and the sultanate was subjugated to colonial authority. Most of the current palace was built by Sultan Hamengkubuwono VIII (who reigned from 1921 to 1939), and was rebuilt after earthquakes in 1876 and 2006. - amazing - Love this place, so many history

Not only you can learn and see Bapak Tino Sidin''s paintings and drawing, but also you can try to draw using his steps. The ticket is affordable, Rp 10.000,- for adult and Rp 5.000,- for kids. - A homage mini museum for local artist, so it might not really suitable for foreigners, though if you want to learn drawing in a day, you can try to visit.

Located in a narrow and busy street, the place will be hard to miss from the road since it has a big statue of the artist at the side road.
It is the artist''s private home with some parts are converted into museum to commemorate his works.
Tino Sidin is a local artist well-know in the late 80''s to early 90''s for appearing in the national television channel. His program was a simple drawing show for kids but super popular, kids sent their drawing from all over the country in wish for being showed during the last minutes of the show. He would teach kids to draw easily with step by step instructions and gave positive feedback throughout the show. For him, all drawing is good, none is so-so let alone bad.

When you enter the front side of the house/museum, you will be met with the in house museum educator that will welcome you. Then you can write on the guest book and pay the ticket. If you are students, the price will be different. By the time I visited, regular ticket is 10k and student''s is 5k.

You can venture around the museum but be careful since it is still part of someone''s house (the late artist youngest daughter lives in the house).
The second floor contains more artworks and if you''re lucky, you can see the museum''s students'' artworks as well. FYI, they open drawing classes for kids.

At the end of the tour, the educator will let you sit on a mat and play a documentary about the artist. Then, you can learn to draw Tino Sidin style from the only remaining episode of the show (since made before the digital era, other episodes are ruined by mold and or missing from inventory T.T )

Tips:
Though it is a small museum, people come from all over Indonesia especially those who grew up during the artist''s TV program. So come early to avoid crowd since the place is small and will be packed just by coming in a group of 10.
No parking area is provided. If you go by motorbikes, you can park in front of the front door but usually the house owner parks her car there.
If you go by car, you can only park on the street side (a very busy one).
The artist''s artworks are mostly prohibited from documentation along with the only remaining episode. So, please respect the rules. - So nostalgic. The place is actually Pak Tino''s house. The guide was his daughter when we went. She was fantastic. Tickets were 10k for adults and 5k for children. At the end of the visit, we learnt how to draw by watching Pak Tino''s show from when I was a kid. I LOVED IT!
Not many yogyakartans know the place tho. Why the heck nottttt? - A special & meaningful place. P Tino Sidin is an unsung hero that has contributed greatly to build foundation of Indonesia‚Äôs artistic development - Nice place to make your children love drawing"

There was live music and lighting effects for the show. Overall performance was okay. The children artists were entertaining with their acrobatic effort. Small fireworks were used to depict conflict in the story which could get rather loud for babies or very small children.

Seating is in a amphitheatre with no back rest but a thin cushion is provided for a base. It gets a bit uncomfortable as the performance is an hour and a half. - I really enjoyed Indonesian traditional ballet performance. The story is very famous so it must be better search and read stories before you arrive here. Location is good if you stay at downtown, stage and seats are also clean and good. - Wow.

Well done Mandira Baruga!! - The dancing was out of this world.  I really didn''t know what to expect,  but the whole thing was phenomenal.  Great customs,  dancing and a live orchestra.  I also had the dinner buffet.  It was a little pricey,  but it was tasty and had all sorts of local dishes.  It was easy to just eat and then proceed to the shore. There was also live music and a dancer during the meal. A very nice atmosphere.  It''s all covered,  so it''s no big deal when it rains. - Food is good (buffet) and the show also.

Kayaking can also be another activity that you can do. Photographers are everywhere to help you taking beautiful family photos with affordable fee. The foods are also delicious on a standard price. Everything is affordable. Come and visit, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. - Around 2017 when I was in 9th grade, I visited this beach during the school tour. The road to the beach is uphill and winding because it is located in the highland. The beach is far from the main street so if you want to visit this beach, you should go using your vehicle like a car or motorbike, or you can ride the local transportation called ojek (motorcycle taxi).

This beach is not as famous as Parangtritis but the view is much better than Parangtritis beach, in my opinion. The beach is surrounded by hills because it is located in the highland, the sand is still white, and the water is still as clear as a crystal. You can also rent snorkeling equipment if you want to see the underwater creatures. There are a lot of small shops and restaurants here if you want to avoid the sunny and hot weather, and most of the shops and restaurants have rest room and praying room for the visitors. Although the scenery is beautiful, there were not much visitors at this beach, so it is the best place for you if you want to relieve the stress by seeing such a beautiful view.

Overall, this beach is a perfect destination for holiday. Even though it is far from the center of Yogyakarta, it worth the wait. The scenery is amazing, the price for foods and drinks is normal, and the local guides are really nice and helpful."

Quite a journey to go there but it was paid off. The beach is clean. Toilets available even not a proper one. If you want to get a better picture, you can climb the rock (?) hill. Just be careful because it''s not safely equipped.

Several camping equipments also available to rent. Perfect. Definitely coming back here. - One of the good beaches in Jogja, the beach is still quite quiet, suitable for family camping or with friends, very affordable entrance tickets, large and safe parking area, highly recommendedüíú"

White sand, quiet and silent beach surounded with rocky hills...

The road is better than some many other road to Gunungkidul beaches ...
Be careful because some pickup car seem like to drive fast enough in the road near the beach ...

Its absolutely beautiful small temple complex. Two big structures are still standing tall, whereas other smaller ones are in ruins. But the magnificence of the temple will blow you away.

The idols at the places are missing and renovation works are still happening. The place looks like a remain of an olden hindu temple which would have been a really big place of worship.
The entry fee is 50k for foreigners and 20k for locals.
Compared to spending more at Prambanan, i would suggest visiting this temple. - If you already been to Prambanan, you should try Candi Plaosan. It''s not very big neither small temple who has been damaged by earthquake, but still most important parts of the temple are standing. - Good value for money.  Its the only temple we''ve been to that we were allowed to enter.

The best time to visit this temple are either in the morning or in the afternoon around 3pm-5pm (it closed on 5pm).

Don''t miss the beautiful carvings of decorative motifs, heavenly beings, and the bodhisattvas.

Travel Guides to Indonesia

We used¬†Lonely Planet`s Indonesia¬†book on our travels around Indonesia and Bali. It was great!

1) ùêíùê°ùê¢ùêØùêö ùêìùê´ùê¶ùê©ùê•ùêû :-

The Candi Shiva Mahadeva temple, dedicated to Shiva, is not only the largest of the temples of Prambanan but also the finest. The main spire is incredibly aroun 40-5 m high and its stones are beautifully carved.
The Shiva temple contains five chambers, four small chambers in every cardinal direction, and one bigger main chamber in the central part of the temple.
Its base is decorated with small lions flanked by kalpatura (trees of heaven), as well as stylized half-human and half-bird kinnara (heavenly beings). Aren`t they  ùêØùêûùê´ùê≤ ùêõùêûùêöùêÆùê≠ùê¢ùêüùêÆùê•?

2) ùêïùê¢ùê¨ùê°ùêßùêÆ ùêìùêûùê¶ùê©ùê•ùêû :-
The Candi Vishnu temple is smaller than the impressive Shiva Mahadeva temple and sits just north of it, reaching around 30-40 m in height. Of course, we had to walk the steep stairs up to the top plateau. And it was totally worth the climb as the temple is magnificent containing reliefs telling the story of Lord Krishna who is the hero of the Mahabharata story.

The most impressive part of this temple is, in my opinion, the statue of a four-armed Vishnu the Preserver in the inner chamber. It is so really big and beautifully carved.

3)ùêÅùê´ùêöùê°ùê¶ùêö ùêìùêûùê¶ùê©ùê•ùêû:-

This temple is the twin temple of Candi Vishnu, as they are exactly similar! It is situated just south of the big Candi Shiva Mahadeva temple, so the two twin temples make a nice symmetric scene.

When you enter this temple, look up and admire the spectacular ‚Äúmonster mouth‚Äù doorway, which is beautiful.

ùêéùê≠ùê°ùêûùê´ ùêèùê•ùêöùêúùêû :-

Nandi temple¬†‚Äì Contains a statue of bull Nandi belonging to Shiva, as well as¬†the statue of Chandra the god of the moon, and Surya the god of the sun. Chandra stands on his carriage pulled by 10 horses, and the statue of Surya is also standing on a carriage pulled by 7 horses.

Hamsa/ Angsa temple¬†‚Äì ¬†Contains no statue, but it probably once housed a statue of the sacred swan Hamsa for the god Brahma.

Garuda temple¬†‚Äì Neither this temple contains a statue. Probably this temple once contained the statue of kite Garuda belonging to god Vishnu. Garuda holds an important role for Indonesia, as it serves as the national symbol of Indonesia, and also as the name of the airline Garuda Indonesia.

When you enter this temple, look up and admire the spectacular ‚Äúmonster mouth‚Äù doorway, which is beautiful.

Prambanan is the biggest and most complete remains of Java`s period of Hindu culture, built in the middle of the 9th century AD, around 50 years later than Borobudur. Little is known about its early history, but it is believed that it was built by king Rakai Pikatan to mark the return of a Hindu dynasty in Java after decades of Buddhism. Prambanan was completely in ruins for years until 1937 when the reconstruction started,  and it is still far from complete.

Even though Prambanan is a big tourist sight, it was peaceful and not too crowded when we visited. We could easily walk around the complex and take in its atmosphere. Prambanan is much more relaxed than Borobodur, here we were left alone and not hunted down by Indonesian wanting to take selfies with us. - Vishunu is a Hindu God as ""the Preserver.""
One of the trinity of supreme divinity in Hinduism.
In Vaishnavism, Vishnu is the supreme being who creates, protects, and transforms the universe.
Vishnu iconography shows him with dark blue, blue-gray or black colored skin, and as a well dressed jeweled man.
*learning for myself - The panels depict the life of Hindu god Krishna. Fortunately it also gives a fascinating picture of life in Java about 1200 years back.
Invaluable! - The beautiful hindhu Vishnu temple"

Located in front of a hotel, the shape of the front of a big ship is hard to miss from the traffic. You must pay for IDR 2.000 for entry and write on the guestbook. The first floor of the exhibition building contains mementos from other countries gifted towards the Indonesian maritime. Make sure you don''t miss any single shelf since each country has their own unique items.
Then you will go to the second floor which has more of Indonesian maritime stuffs being displayed with a little bit of foreign items, too.
After that, the museum staff will ask you to come to the ''ship'' building nearby the exhibition building. You will go to the second floor where you can enter a small bridge (the commando room). The last stop would be a small theater room below the bridge. You will watch a short movie about the history of Indonesian maritime. Don''t miss the movie since it is very good (disclosure: the movie is in Bahasa) - Great place to teach the children about the maritime of Indonesia. It''s cheap and clean. - for only IDR 2K for the admission ticket, this museum is small indeed. there is a two-story building with seemingly private collection of documents, warship and navy boat models, statues, insignias, etc. it also lacks of lighting (it was turned off even when we come visiting the room). probably the most interesting part is only the ship bridge which contains ship''s wheel, maps cabinet, electronic instruments, etc. you could take nice instagram picture here. - While named as Maritime Museum (Museum Maritime), most of this museum collection is Indonesian Navy paraphernalia. This should not surprise you if you know that the founder of this museum is an Indonesian Navy Officer.

Coming to this museum we are greeted by a naval gun turret. Behind the gun is a mock ship bridge, in fact the lay out of the whole building looks like ship if seen from afar.

As mentioned above, you would find Indonesian Navy paraphernalia such as uniform, officer sword, and rank badge/epsulette. It would be fascinating to kids who loves all thing military. Of course you could buy some stuff in this museum.

The mock bridge is equipped with real ship control and gauges, so get your fantasy & imagination going! You could try to be a siipper here! - Little museum - 30 mins max - only if you''re a fan of the subject, otherwise spend time elsewhere..."

My first impression of this museum was the lush atmosphere from the garden full of different kind of trees (it''s nice). This is a private museum owned by a university professor (now it''s managed by his son). The collections are all about wayang or traditional puppet. They have so many wayang even some which came from other countries. The collections are definitely amazing but the management is bad. The building is not well treated (there should be good lighting, air conditioner and cctv). The collections are also not well treated (they don''t have curator). Outside of the museum there are a lot of unused cars that makes the surrounding look dirty (the cars belong to the son of the owner). - Good olace for educational purpose avout puppets especially Javanese puppets. You can learn here with good atmosphere :)) - Verry verry interesting, there is full 100 kurawas wayang''dolls.

The street is the centre of Yogyakarta''s largest tourist district surrounded with many hotels, restaurants, and shops nearby.

Bad experience from what I had, I''m a new traveler and don''t understand the tariff rule of 10,000, which means we are invited to go for a walk, with the condition that we have to buy snacks along the Jogja center for souvenirs Maliobor, Bringharjo, and the Jogja Palace, so that the collision gets points. As a result of my ignorance of this, I didn''t snack along the way because I just followed a friend who was riding a bump in front for my friend who was wanting to shop. My rickshaw-motorcycle friend and I were treated quite unpleasantly by the collision because they didn''t get any points because we didn''t have any snacks, even when I paid more, the money was just thrown on the ground and only 10,000 was taken, because he said he didn''t got points and got annoyed with us because we didn''t snack.
Maybe that night I was unlucky to have the driver crash, whereas it seems the other crashes are not a problem and are still behaving well.

For new tourists, I suggest you should ask first, if someone offers a bump at a rate of 10,000, it''s really just going around Malioboro tourism / we MUST HAVE SALTS AROUND THE CENTER OF THE SELECTIONS so he GETS POINTS, thank you. - The second time I came here I found this place crowded with various cultural tribes spilling out on the streets.

It is also in this area that I enjoy evening evenings at Malioboro, a literary community with anthology readings.

In this place I also feel the real road pavement, wide and lots of seats.

There is a Hamzah batik shop that is never empty, and chicken satay traders, carriages and street buskers fill the crowded streets

The more crowded the more interesting - The location is always crowded for pedestrians to pass by, it''s even more exciting when in the afternoon there is a musical song that is played together, it''s always busy, the seller is friendly, really suitable for pedestrians, while looking at what want to be in wholesale to be used as souvenirs when returning to their respective cities, for gifts the price ranges from 10,000 to 35,000 so everything is still friendly..."

Price: affordable, but you need to be able to appraise the items for the best deal.
Parking: it''s always be a problem to get a parking space here, especially during holiday season.
Hospitality: mostly, the sellers are friendly.
Atmosphere: just like any other traditional market in Indonesia, they were crowded. - The local wisdom of yogjakarta. Shop till you drop.... Why? Reasonable price. Come in with hopes and smile...leaving with wider smile - A favorite traditional market in Malioboro Yogyakarta, consisting of three sections: batik section, dry market and wet market. Recommended to explore all sections, and you may find many local products. I found it quite neat. And...your ability to bargain will be tested :D - One stop center for souvenirs.
Bags, t shirt, herbs/jamu, traditional wear, toys & many more.
But Most shops can''t bargain much.

Going early in the morning is better.
Not crowded.
